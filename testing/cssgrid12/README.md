# CSS Grid Framework
====================

Emulates some behavior of the popular Bootstrap Grid 
by using CSS Grid Layout instead of Flexbox.

## Benefits
- Heavily reduce markup
- Easier maintenance
- Easy transition from Bootstrap Grid

## Features
- [x] Responsive grid container 
- [x] `.grid--no-gutters`
- [x] `col-*`, where * is 1 - 12
- [x] `order-*`, where * is "first", "last", or 0 - 12.
- [ ] responsive classes for all breakpoints.
- [ ] grid positioning utilities.

## To Do:
- 

## Cannot Implement
- `.col`, `.col-auto`: since css grid items must fit along grid.
- `offset-*`, however this could potentially work with JavaScript.
