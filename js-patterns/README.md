## Design Pattern Structure
Useful template for structuring documentation for solutions
- **Pattern name** and a **description**
- **Context outline** – the contexts in which the pattern is effective in responding to the users needs.
- **Problem statement** – a statement of the problem being addressed so we can understand the intent of the pattern.
- **Solution** – a description of how the user’s problem is being solved in an understandable list of steps and perceptions.
- **Design** – a description of the pattern’s design and in particular, the user’s behavior in interacting with it
- **Implementation** – a guide to how the pattern would be implemented
- **Illustrations** – a visual representation of classes in the pattern (e.g. a diagram)
- **Examples** – an implementation of the pattern in a minimal form
- **Co-requisites** – what other patterns may be needed to support use of the pattern being described?
- **Relations** – what patterns does this pattern resemble? does it closely mimic any others?
- **Known usage** – is the pattern being used in the wild? If so, where and how?
- **Discussions** – the team or author’s thoughts on the exciting benefits of the pattern
